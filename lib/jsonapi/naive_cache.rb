  # Cache which memoizes the given block.
  #
  # It's "naive" because it clears the least-recently-inserted cache entry
  # rather than the least-recently-used. This makes lookups faster but cache
  # misses more frequent after cleanups. Therefore you the best time to use
  # this cache is when you expect only a small number of unique lookup keys, so
  # that the cache never has to clear.
  #
  # Also, it's not thread safe (although jsonapi-resources is careful to only
  # use it in a thread safe way).
